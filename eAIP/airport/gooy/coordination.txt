===== GOOY Coordination =====

==== GOOY & GOBD ====

  * GOBD/GOOY Controllers, particularly Tower and Approach, should be mindful of simultaneous operations at [[GOBD]] and [[GOOY]]. In most cases, both airports will operate similar runway configurations (North/South). The fact that both airports are 30 nm apart allows for some maneuvering room, but during events, release management should be coordinated through Diass Approach.

==== GOOY & GVSC ====

  * For flights departing GOOY to airports at Cape Verde, GOBD Approach should coordinate with GVSC CTR or GVSC APP. In the absence of GOOO CTR and/or GVSC CTR, GOBD APP is authorized to handover traffic to GVSC APP.

==== GOOY & GOOO ====

  * Flights departing GOOY for GQNO can be handed over from GOBD Approach to GQNO Approach.

==== GOOY & Oceanic ====

  * Oceanic Clearances are not required.
