===== GOOY Pilot Briefing =====

//Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to GOOY should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.//

==== Overview ====

  * GOOY Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport is Dakar's old international airport with a limited capacity for high traffic events. Although it is a dual runway airport, IFR traffic should (almost) always depart from runways 18/36. And although there are many parking positions, the limited taxiway does not provide for a lot of flexibility in terms of ground operations.

==== Departure Briefing ====

=== Clearance Delivery ===

* GOOY does not have a real world Delivery position. We have created GOBD_DEL which will operate as a Consolidated Delivery Position for both GOBD and GOOY, exclusively for busy events. If offline, contact Tower for Delivery Clearance.

* When requesting IFR clearance, please provide your Aircraft Type and Stand Number.

=== Departure Procedures ===

* GOOY does not have structured departure procedures (SIDs) so you are expected to maintain runway heading until further instructions. Do not deviate from the runway heading after takeoff.


==== Arrival Briefing ====

=== Arrivals and Approaches ===

 * As your flight is approaching GOOY , you should make yourself familiar with the existing Holding Points and Approaches. GOOY does not have structured arrival procedures (STARs).

 * GOOY is a dual runway airport with only one exit Taxiway, requiring most aircraft to backtrack. Prepare to hold.

 * In case of Missed Approach, climb 2100 ft and maintain runway heading. Expect to follow the published Missed Approach procedure and hold.

=== Parking and Ground Operations ===

* GOOY has plenty of parking positions across multiple aprons. Initial aircraft may be offered the Main Terminal Apron whilst subsequent aircraft will be directed to adjacent Aprons. There is limited parking availability at the Cargo Apron and due to its location on the airfield, you may be requested to taxi to a different parking position during busy events.
